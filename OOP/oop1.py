#OOP pillars:
"""1. ENCAPSULATION 
  Wrap variables(parameters)and methods(functions or behaviour)into single class. Utilities it using objects of specific classes.

Example:
class BankAccount:
    def _init_(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private variable

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

Functions are made to return value.

2. ABSTRACTION :
Hides complex implementation details from end users...

3. INHERITANCE
child class(sub class) inherit both attributes and behaviors from parent class(super class). 





4. POLYMORPHISM 
i. METHOD OVERRIDING:
    Same function name, same parameters but different behaviour.

ii. METHOD OVERLOADING:
    Same function name, same behaviour but different parameter.

#MRO stands for Method Resolution Order.
"""It is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a hierarchy of classes during inheritance.

When you call a method on an object, Python doesn't just check that class
it looks through the entire inheritance chain in a specific order.
This order is decided by the MRO."""

    def show(self):
        super().show()
        print("D")

print(D.mro())
obj = D()
obj.show()
"""
#Explanation:
"""
Step 1 ‚Äî The MRO of class D

Let‚Äôs check:

print(D.mro())


You‚Äôll get:

[<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]


That means the order in which Python will search for methods is:
üëâ D ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí A ‚Üí object

üß© Step 2 ‚Äî What happens when you call obj.show()?

Let‚Äôs trace it step by step:

You called:

obj.show()


So, it first looks inside class D.

In class D, the method is:

def show(self):
    super().show()
    print("D")


First, it calls super().show() ‚Üí which means go to the next class in MRO after D, which is B.

Then after that call finishes, it prints "D".

ü™ú Step 3 ‚Äî Now inside class B

B.show() runs:

def show(self):
    super().show()
    print("B")


Again, super().show() means go to the next class in MRO after B, which is C.

Then it prints "B".

ü™ú Step 4 ‚Äî Now inside class C

C.show() runs:

def show(self):
    super().show()
    print("C")


Again, super().show() means go to next in MRO after C, which is A.

Then it prints "C".

ü™ú Step 5 ‚Äî Now inside class A

A.show() runs:

def show(self):
    print("A")


Just prints "A", no more super() here.

üß† Step 6 ‚Äî Now all methods finish in reverse order

After A.show() finishes, the control goes back up:

Back to C.show() ‚Üí prints "C"

Then to B.show() ‚Üí prints "B"

Finally to D.show() ‚Üí prints "D"

‚úÖ Final Output:
A
C
B
D

üí° Why this order?

Because of MRO (D ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí A)
And because super() follows that same order to move to the next class in MRO, not necessarily the ‚Äúparent‚Äù class in the diagram.

‚ú® In short:

super() doesn‚Äôt always mean ‚Äúcall the parent class‚Äù.

It means ‚Äúcall the next class in the MRO chain‚Äù.

MRO ensures methods are called in a consistent left-to-right order even in multiple inheritance."""


#CONSTRUCTION:
